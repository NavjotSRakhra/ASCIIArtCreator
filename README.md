# ASCII Art Creator

## Introduction

After seeing a YouTube video by The Coding Train, I decided to make my own version of ASCII art generator. This is
designed to work in console, terminal and command prompt. I have tested it on terminal, and it works well. It takes
image path as parameter and converts the image into ASCII art.

## Usage

To use this program go to the project folder and follow the following steps:

1. ``cd ../ASCII\ art``
2. ``javac --source-path src -d . src/ASCIIArtCreator.java``
3. ``java ASCIIArtCreator -cs resources/AndSymbol.png``
    * its usage is ``java ASCIIArtCreator <options> <pixels> <path to source image>``
    * Available options :
        * ``-i : Disables the pop up of a 400x400 scaled version of selected image``
        * ``-s : Adding this option renders and saves the ASCII art as .png image``
        * ``-a : Character set 1``
        * ``-b : Character set 2``
        * ``-c : Character set 3``
        * ``-d : Character set 4``
    * Note that use **only one** of the a, b, c or d option at a time otherwise the behaviour is undefined
    * ``<pixels>``  refer to the number of pixels to which the image is to be scaled

## Technologies used

This project was created in OpenJDK 11. It has been test on Ubuntu platform using OpenJDK 11, and it works on this
platform. It should work on higher versions of JDK as well.
